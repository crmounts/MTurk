MTurk is a mobile turking application that enables users to be paid for two different
types of tasks. Taking photos and allowing location to be tracked.

Clicking on the task will in the table view will open the appropriate screen for carrying 
out that type of task.

In order for the application to work properly the first thing a new user has to do is go
and link their account to a bitcoin wallet. This can be done in the more tab and is very
straightforward. Note that completion of the tasks actually results in real money being
transferred to the associated bitcoin wallet. That money comes from a holding wallet that
I set up for the application, for obvious reasons there is not that much money in that
holding wallet, once that account runs out of money the payments will no longer happen and
the user will get errors, so just keep that in mind when testing the application.
